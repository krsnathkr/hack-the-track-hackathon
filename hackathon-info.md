# Hack the Track presented by Toyota GR

Unleash the Data. Engineer Victory.

This repository documents our participation in the “Hack the Track presented by Toyota GR” hackathon on Devpost. The event challenges developers, data scientists, students, and motorsport fans to deliver high-impact insights and tools using real racing datasets from past Toyota victories.

## Overview

Hack the Track is an online, public hackathon focused on applying racing telemetry, lap times, and sensor data to build innovative software, predictive models, analytical reports, or interactive dashboards. Teams compete for $20,000 in cash prizes while showcasing design, data application, impact, and originality.

- Platform: Devpost
- Deadline: November 24, 2025 @ 5:00 PM PST
- Eligibility: Above legal age of majority in your country; most countries/territories allowed (standard exceptions apply)
- Datasets: Provided by Toyota Racing Development (TRD)
- Focus: Real-time analytics and strategy tools for the GR Cup Series, plus other categories

## Why Join

- Analyze a unique professional motorsports dataset
- Build tools and insights for drivers, engineers, and fans
- Compete for cash prizes and recognition

## Categories

Choose one to compete in:

1. Driver Training & Insights — Tools or analyses to identify improvement areas, optimize racing lines, or explain driver performance
2. Pre-Event Prediction — Forecast qualifying results, race pace, tire degradation, or other KPIs before race start
3. Post-Event Analysis — Dashboards or reports that narrate key moments and strategies behind race outcomes
4. Real-Time Analytics — Decision-support tools for engineers (pit windows, caution response, race strategy)
5. Wildcard — Creative applications that don’t fit the above categories

Note: Organizers are especially interested in real-time analytics and strategy tools for the GR Cup Series.

## Judging Criteria

Projects are evaluated on:
- Application of TRD Datasets — Effective, unique use aligned with the chosen category
- Design — Thoughtful user experience and balance of frontend/backend
- Potential Impact — Value for the Toyota Racing community and beyond
- Quality of the Idea — Creativity, uniqueness, and improvement over existing concepts

## Prizes

Total: $20,000
- Grand Prize: $7,000 cash + (2) 3-day GA tickets to one 2026 Toyota Customer Racing event (SRO America)
- Second Place: $5,000 cash
- Third Place: $3,000 cash
- Best of Driver Training/Insights: $1,000 cash
- Best of Pre-Event Predictions: $1,000 cash
